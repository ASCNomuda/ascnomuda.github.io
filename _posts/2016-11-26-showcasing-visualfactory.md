Showcasing VisualFactory

HUGE interest and great feedback - thanks to all those who came to see us at the Southern Manufacturing & Electronics Exhibition.

Our wall of technology was packed with people trying the world's most advanced visual work instruction software for themselves - getting 'hands-on' and quickly realising the huge benefits.

The show also saw the unveiling of our 'cube challenge' - designed to demonstrate - in just a few minutes - how powerful a tool VisualFactory is.

"It was simple - we designed a puzzle cube and asked you to build it for us," Sales Manager Mario Grandinetti said.

"You could log onto our challenge website and choose to put it together by using the static 'paper on glass' instructions provided - or by accessing the dynamic VisualFactory instructions.

"As we predicted, many of you tried to build the cube without instructions - or with the paper on glass approach. And you failed! Those who succeeded carefully followed our VisualFactory instructions."

The challenge perfectly highlights the errors it is all too easy to make without clear visual instruction, with individual assumption, interpretation and complacency coming into play.

"VisualFactory is all about 'what you need to know, when you need to know it' - follow the instructions to the letter and you get consistent, repeatable results; right first time," Mario added.

If you missed out - contact us to try the cube for yourself - we can come out to chat to you about VisualFactory - or chat via video online.

Why not send us a sample of your work instructions and we'll upload them into Visual Factory's V-Screen for you - and give you access for a limited time so you can see the huge benefits for yourself?

It will cost you nothing to give it a try - opening the door on vast savings in both time and money.

<br>Q&A with our Managing Director

GREAT to see VisualFactory featured in the March issue of Assembly Magazine

Managing Director Phil Borland talked extensively to the magazine's reporter to give him an insight into the world of visual work instructions - and the benefits they bring.

His knowledge unrivalled; here's an overview of the answers he provided. Essential reading for anyone looking to start their lean journey…

Q: How common are paperless/visual work instructions today?

A: There is a lot of scope for interpretation here. There are many companies selling paperless/visual systems that really are not visual. Putting a few photos in a paragraph of text does not make it visual. There are also companies delivering interactive solid models to the workstation. The key test to determine if a visual / paperless system will deliver the benefits, is to take a trained worker and move them to a new station or to a product or process with which they are not familiar. They should be able to build the product, without any assistance, within cycle time, and Right First Time.

Q: What types of manufacturers tend to use paperless systems?

A: Our customers cover a range of sectors, off-highway vehicles, construction equipment, military communications, Formula 1, rail, food service equipment, industrial equipment, power transmission equipment, aerospace and sub-sea to name a few. The common thread is complex assembly, often associated with high variety and frequent change. VisualFactory is unique in that it can cope with hundreds or thousands of model variants, without creating thousands of documents.

Q: Why are some manufacturers still using paper work instructions?

A: Why are they reluctant to go paperless? People don't understand it is a game changer. 30 years ago many companies still used paper or spreadsheets for the accounts, typewriters or word processors for invoices, and a card index system for inventory control. I haven't seen a company using these tools in business administration for a very long time. And yet the same concept is not true on the shop floor, the place where the product is actually made.

Q: What are manufacturers looking for today in paperless work instructions?

A: It varies greatly. We often know how the evaluation will turn out during the first few minutes of discussion. Although VisualFactory delivers paperless work instructions it is much more than that, so we are much happier talking to customers who are looking to implement world class, lean, six sigma manufacturing in a simple, standardized and sustainable way. The businesses that will get the most out of the system are those asking: "How can I improve quality whilst reducing cost in my complex manufacturing environment?" Many companies aren't even looking - they assume it cannot be done so keep doing it the same old way.

 Q: How are today's paperless systems different to what was available 5-10 years ago?

A: 10 Years ago VisualFactory delivered step by step work instructions and could cope with a degree of product variety. Today it provides a comprehensive Lean shop floor execution system.

Q: What's the biggest benefit of going paperless?

A: When we started developing VisualFactory the benefits we targeted were in reducing the engineering time taken to create, manage and maintain the work instructions. In use however, our approach delivers increased productivity, reduced training time and has a massive impact on assembly errors. Our customers report increased productivity up to 10 per cent and elimination of end of line rectification. Productivity increases because the optimal process is always used, even if the model or option is rarely seen, the correct process is always available and so time is not lost in refreshing memory or working out the process. Similarly because of the added labour flexibility, workers can move stations or work areas easily and work in a controlled process. Quality is also greatly impacted by ensuring the correct process is used.

Q: What are the challenges of going paperless?

A: Many customers underestimate the amount of "tribal knowledge" and "memorized build" on the shop floor. Faced with a range of similar products they will create a set of generic instructions that apply to all models by virtue of lack of detail. Drilling down to the next level of detail can often come as a shock and undoubtedly provides a substantial amount of work for the business moving from the "drawings,rRouter and skilled worker" approach. The benefits massively outweigh the costs however and taking a worker to a new station and seeing them build within cycle, with no issues, is the dream of many operations managers.

Q: What is the biggest mistake that engineers make when adopting paperless work instructions on their assembly lines? How can that be avoided?

A: We provide on-site consulting and training during implementation as the adoption of VisualFactory often requires a change of mindset for the engineers. Un-learning years of "document based" work instructions can take some adjustment and even during training it isn't until the second day that the engineers fully understand the power of dynamic instructions that can cope with high variety, but at the same time provide auditable links to authority engineering data. Once the potential has been realised, the temptation is to try to implement everything at once. Implementation must be phased and managed to ensure successful adoption.

Q: What makes VisualFactory's solution unique?

A: VisualFactory is developed by NoMuda, a company founded on and steeped in the Toyota Production Systems/Lean approach. We don't sell software, we sell a solution and work with customers to ensure the deliverables are achieved. Our deep understanding of the principles ensures that the software conforms to best practice principles. Because we understand manufacturing, we understand the challenges, how to cope with thousands of product models, how to respond when products do not conform, and that management need to know where the areas of concern are, so they can be addressed, not where the site of the latest disaster is.
