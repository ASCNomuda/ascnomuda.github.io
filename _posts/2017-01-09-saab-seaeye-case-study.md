description: "Summary\nSaab Seaeye had become very reliant on staff knowledge; little production information was written down, most of it jotted in operator’s notebooks. \n\nIf staff left, so did their knowledge. The company wanted to get information out of heads and into a proper system. \n\nThis dependence on experience meant staff training was time consuming, with productivity and quality inconsistent.\n\nBuilding working instructions correctly with VisualFactory solved virtually all problems. It enabled the company to consistently control both product build process and quality."

### The Results

1. ##### 75% 1st year cost reduction
2. ##### Return on investment in just 2 years
3. ##### 90% expected 2nd year cost reduction

### Saab Seaeye

A World leader in underwater vehicles, Saab Seaeye is the world's largest manufacturer of electric Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs).

This includes Saab's range of tethered, autonomous and hybrid underwater vehicle systems for the defence industry.&nbsp;

Saab Seaeye’s products set the benchmark by which all electric powered ROVs are compared today.

### Challenges

Saab Seaeye wanted to get control of their Work Instructions and turn knowledge in people’s heads into permanent, company information. The company was:

* Dangerously reliant on operator’s experience
* Products were built from people’s knowledge with limited written or detailed instructions
* When people left, so did their expertise
* Training new staff was a time-consuming process
* Productivity and quality was inconsistent

#### New System Goals

* A manageable & flexible solution to the generation and maintenance of WIs
* Reduce the labour costs involved with MI generation and maintenance
* Able to respond rapidly to the changing requirements of Lean Manufacturing
* Increase the quality and consistency of the production documentation
* Reduce the learning curve for the introduction of new product variants

### How We Helped

NoMuda introduced a new philosophy to WI authoring, maximising benefit from VF's lean approach. For every product range one set of instructions is created, covering all processes to build all variants.&nbsp;

VisualFactory tracks all tasks displaying to each operator only those pages required for the particular variant being assembled.

Management found that this had a huge impact on productivity and quality. They reported feeling that VF and it's lean approach had 'given them control back', and that 'problems had just gone away'.

It was found that they could now build accurately to cost, quality and time targets.

#### The Numbers

In 2011 the cost was &pound;268,000

By 2012, that figure was &pound;52,000

In 2013, it’s expected to be as low as &pound;28,000
