#### Summary

Before VisualFactory, Esterline had created work instructions in a number of different formats. They'd tried a desktop publishing package – but it was inflexible and extremely slow.

They found themselves fire-fighting a never-ending stream of problems, the chances of ever doing ‘proper’ production engineering seemed non-existent.
<br>They needed a way to impose order, and VisualFactory did just that.

Since introducing VisualFactory, Esterline have reduced rejects to around 0.5%, increased productivity by up to 15%, and reduced work instruction pages to be maintained by 88%

#### Esterline Racal

Esterline Racal products are world-leading, high quality, state-of-the-art military electronic digital systems and components designed to operate in the most severe battle environments.

From secure audio and data systems to rugged noise-cancelling handsets and headsets, the Racal operation, acquired by the specialist manufacturer Esterline Corporation in 2008, is on the frontline of battlefield communication.

#### Challenges

Before VisualFactory, work instructions had been created in a number of different formats – some of them more than 30 years old. This included photocopies of original Gestetner duplicator pages – corrected with Snopake or Tippex, and then re-photocopied.

They were a very busy Production Engineering department, but struggling to keep up with just the shop floor queries and change notes. None of their production engineers had any real picture of where they were with any single product.

They had to break the cycle, or they were going to be buried in ever increasing paperwork.

##### New System Goals

* A manageable & flexible solution to the generation and maintenance of WIs.
* Reduce the labour costs involved with WI generation and maintenance.
* Able to respond more rapidly to the changing requirements of Lean Manufacturing.
* Increase the quality and consistency of the production documentation available.
* Reduce the learning curve associated with the introduction of a new product variant

#### How We Helped

VisualFactory had a tremendous impact. They were maintaining only about 12% of the instruction pages as previously, each instruction was now written only once but used in multiple locations, creating massive benefits.

Training took only about half a day and staff found the software very easy to use.

With the task always presented to the operator in the same way, the learning curve is dramatically reduced.

Instructions for a variant of an existing product family can now be written in hours, not days or weeks, as previously.

The speed of bringing valid and accurate information to the production floor also meant much greater production flexibility.
