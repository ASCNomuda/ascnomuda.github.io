THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED VISUAL WORK INSTRUCTIONS - AND MORE
<br>Let VisualFactory take care of all your manufacturing records as well - and deliver you the most comprehensive overview available.

All data delivered to your desktop.

The simple way to see what's going right - and what's going wrong.

So you can optimize efficiency.

Trust us - and our world leading clients - it can be done.

VisualFactory is the world's most advanced visual work instruction software - the digital tool for lean strategies. Forget pages of complex, written instructions - time consuming to produce and time consuming to use. VisualFactory simplifies and streamlines manufacturing processes by providing visual - easy to navigate - work instructions to production lines. Web-based, modular software designed to make high variety, complex assemblies extremely simple and cost effective.

But that's not all. VisualFactory also simplifies and standardizes all data from production lines - recording every step in the manufacturing process and creating records to give you a complete - and very clear - overview right on your desktop.

Don't just take our word for it, read on for this month's case study from another client reaping the rewards, and for more on our data management module vRecord.

Easy to implement - with instant results

"THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS WITH THE CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MODULES BEING DONE AT VISUALFACTORY. IT TRULY COULD BE THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL YOUR LEAN MANUFACTURING NEEDS."
<br>A Terex heavy plant earth mover outlined against the sky.CASE STUDY: Terex Equipment Limited
<br>Terex is a world leader in the manufacture of heavy duty equipment - for use in various industries, including construction, infrastructure, quarrying, manufacturing, mining, shipping, transportation, refining, energy and utility.

Part of the Terex Corporation, Terex Equipment Ltd began using VisualFactory in 2012. The benefits were "instant", as Manufacturing Engineer Garry Moore explains:

"We decided that we wanted to move with the times in our factory and employ a paperless system for our work instructions. We were looking for a package with scope to integrate more aspects of our business on the one system.

"VISUAL FACTORY TICKED ALL THESE BOXES AND MORE."
<br>Before VisualFactory, Terex relied on Microsoft Office to produce work instructions.

"This proved time consuming when trying to keep on top of all the engineering changes that occur in our environment," Garry said.

"We continuously improve the product here at Terex and we felt that to do this efficiently, the only way forward was a PC-based system to save on time, money and environmental issues."

But how easy was the switch?

"Introducing Visual Factory was a pleasantly easy experience," Garry says.

"The level of assistance from the guys at NoMuda was outstanding and the continuing support offered is second to none. We have been using the software here for about two years and we are continuing to learn more about the system and employ more modules to further the benefits we are feeling.

"Since Visual Factory has been installed here we have developed more in-depth work instructions and have been able to implement changes on the spot and ensure our work instructions are always up-to-date so that we eradicate errors caused through old work instructions."

Terex is now working with NoMuda to implement other modules from Visual Factory. These include vAndon - a complete overview of the assembly line on your desktop - and vRecord - tracking all assembly data in one place.

The company will be looking to employ more and more modules in the future, according to Garry.

"The benefits we've seen so far were virtually instant," he adds.

"I would recommend other manufacturers to seriously consider using VisualFactory. The ease on the workload of the process engineers is very notable, allowing for other responsibilities to be given more time.

"The team at NoMuda are always on the end of the phone and exceptionally helpful at all times, listening to any changes or additions you would like in future updates.

"Training given at the implementation stage is outstanding and the scope for more onsite training is endless. Furthermore the possibilities are endless with the constant development of new modules being done at VisualFactory."

"IT TRULY COULD BE THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL YOUR LEAN MANUFACTURING NEEDS."
